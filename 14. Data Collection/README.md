In machine learning and data science, collecting high-quality, relevant data is the first and most crucial step. The slide lists multiple common sources from which data can be gathered:

### **1. Databases**

- **SQL Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.
- **NoSQL Databases:** MongoDB, Cassandra, Firebase, etc.
  Used for structured or semi-structured data stored by organizations.

---

### **2. Public Datasets**

- Platforms like **Kaggle**, **UCI Machine Learning Repository**, **Google Dataset Search**, etc.
  These are free and widely used for learning, prototyping, and benchmarking.

---

### **3. APIs**

- **Twitter API**, **Stock Market API**, **Weather API**, etc.
  APIs allow data collection in real time or on-demand from external providers.

---

### **4. Web Scraping**

- Extracting data from **HTML pages**, **blogs**, **news websites**, **social media**, and more.
  Tools: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium.

---

### **5. Sensors & Devices**

- Data from **IoT devices**, **health trackers**, **smartwatches**, etc.
  Common in industries like healthcare, manufacturing, and mobility.

---

### **6. Surveys & Forms**

- Customer feedback, satisfaction forms, questionnaires, etc.
  Often used to capture user opinions and sentiment.

---

### **7. System-Generated Data**

- **Logs**, **video feeds**, **system alerts**, **synthetic data**, etc.
  Generated by machines during operation, often at very large scales.

# **📌 Data Collection – Sources Explained (Detailed Notes)**

Data Collection is the **first and most crucial step** in any AI/ML workflow. The quality of your model depends directly on the quality, quantity, and relevance of the data you collect.

---

## **🔹 1. Databases (SQL & NoSQL)**

Databases are the most structured and reliable data sources for organizations.

### **SQL Databases**

SQL databases follow a **relational model** (tables, rows, columns).
Examples:

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle
- SQL Server

**Characteristics:**

- Follow a predefined schema
- ACID properties (safe & consistent)
- Best for transactional systems

**What type of data you get:**
Customer records, sales data, transactions, user activity logs, etc.

---

### **NoSQL Databases**

Used when data is semi-structured or unstructured.
Examples:

- MongoDB
- Cassandra
- Firebase
- DynamoDB

**Characteristics:**

- Flexible schema
- High scalability
- Stores documents, key-value, graphs, or wide-column data

---

## **🔹 2. Public Datasets**

Freely available datasets for training, research, and practice.

Examples:

- **Kaggle** datasets
- **UCI Machine Learning Repository**
- **Google Dataset Search**
- **Government open data portals**

Use Cases:

- ML competitions
- Research papers
- Model prototyping

---

## **🔹 3. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)**

APIs allow real-time data retrieval from online services.

Examples:

- Twitter API → Sentiment analysis
- Stock Market API → Financial forecasting
- Weather API → Climate/temperature predictions

Use Cases:

- Stream data pipelines
- Real-time dashboards
- Automated monitoring systems

---

## **🔹 4. Web Scraping**

Used to extract data from websites when no API is available.

Tools:

- **BeautifulSoup** (static scraping)
- **Scrapy** (large-scale crawling)
- **Selenium** (dynamic pages & JavaScript websites)

You can scrape:

- Blogs
- E-commerce products
- News
- Social media posts

---

## **🔹 5. Sensors & IoT Devices**

Devices generate large volumes of real-time data.

Examples:

- Smartwatches (heart rate, steps)
- Smart cars (speed, GPS logs)
- Industrial IoT sensors

Use Cases:

- Healthcare analytics
- Manufacturing automation
- Smart city applications

---

## **🔹 6. Surveys & Forms**

Human-input data collected via:

- Google Forms
- Typeform
- Feedback portals

Use Cases:

- Customer satisfaction analysis
- Market research
- Employee engagement ratings

---

## **🔹 7. System-Generated Data**

Automatically generated by machines or software.

Examples:

- Server logs
- Application logs
- Video surveillance feeds
- Synthetic data

Use Cases:

- Fraud detection
- Behavior monitoring
- Anomaly detection

---

# **📌 SQL (Structured Query Language) – Complete Detailed Notes**

SQL is used to **store, manage, and retrieve data** from relational databases.
Every Data Scientist / ML Engineer must know SQL because most real-world data resides in databases.

---

## ## **🔹 Why SQL is Important in Data Science?**

- Extracting data from enterprise databases
- Cleaning & preprocessing large datasets
- Creating features for ML
- Joining multiple tables
- Aggregating data (SUM, AVG, etc.)
- Building dashboards

---

# **📘 SQL Basics (with Examples)**

---

## **1. Creating a Database**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE company;
```

---

## **2. Creating a Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    salary FLOAT,
    department VARCHAR(50)
);
```

---

## **3. Inserting Data**

```sql
INSERT INTO employees VALUES
(1, 'Amit', 28, 45000, 'IT'),
(2, 'Neha', 32, 52000, 'HR');
```

---

## **4. Selecting Data**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

Selecting specific columns:

```sql
SELECT name, salary FROM employees;
```

---

## **5. Filtering Data (WHERE Clause)**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;
```

---

## **6. Sorting Data**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

---

## **7. Updating Records**

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = 60000
WHERE id = 2;
```

---

## **8. Deleting Records**

```sql
DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1;
```

---

# **📊 Advanced SQL Concepts**

---

## **1. Aggregate Functions**

```sql
SELECT AVG(salary), MAX(salary), MIN(salary) FROM employees;
```

---

## **2. GROUP BY**

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

---

## **3. JOINs (VERY Important!)**

### **INNER JOIN**

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d
ON e.department = d.id;
```

### **LEFT JOIN**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments
ON employees.department = departments.id;
```

---

## **4. Subqueries**

```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

---

## **5. SQL for ML Feature Engineering**

- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical data
- Generating statistical summaries
- Creating new features via SQL expressions

Example:

```sql
SELECT name,
       salary,
       salary / 12 AS monthly_salary
FROM employees;
```
